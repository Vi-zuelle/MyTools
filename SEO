. breadcrump : define what we see from the URL. We can use emojis. Position 1 start with the domain
. Q&A : efficient way to get more space on the search result
. video : YT videos appear in the search result. A good way to have an image display when other results don't
. Event : Requires dates (ex. exhibitions for Place des Arts)
. Carousel : several pics we can select, but have to be on our domain (there are ways to trick it though)
. Product : contains many 
. Dataset : Array
. Review : help for the Google authority (the more we have FB likes the better) 
. Local business : we can geolocalise
. Product : we can add many info
. Recipe : only ones displaying the vignette with YT videos

## Test the structured data of a website
1. https://search.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool
2. https://search.google.com/test/rich-results

## Google codelabs
https://codelabs.developers.google.com/

## Google tag manager allow to add code without touching the source code of the website
https://tagmanager.google.com/#/home

## Schema.org has great documentation about the microdata (Google do not use it YET but read it)
https://schema.org/docs/gs.html



Note1: when we use structured data for the search engine, Google display only one of our page in the result (but with the structured data).
Note2: on mobile results, more things are displayed
Note3: each page has its own structured data
Note4: as of Feb 4, 2020 Shopify still uses the old language .RFA (now we can use .json)
Note5: in Wordpress there is a rich snippet plugin
Note6: we'd better push once the dev is finished because it will play on the Google authority. If Google judge our website low quality, it will read it less often.
Note7: errors in our website decrease the G authority
Note8: Google business will not be free anymore in 2020-2021 (Google announcement)

Note: AT THE END ONLY GOOGLE DECIDE WHAT THEY WILL DISPLAY
