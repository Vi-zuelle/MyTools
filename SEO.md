. breadcrump : define what we see from the URL. We can use emojis. Position 1 start with the domain <br>
. Q&A : efficient way to get more space on the search result <br>
. video : YT videos appear in the search result. A good way to have an image display when other results don't <br>
. Event : Requires dates (ex. exhibitions for Place des Arts) <br>
. Carousel : several pics we can select, but have to be on our domain (there are ways to trick it though) <br>
. Product : contains many <br>
. Dataset : Array <br>
. Review : help for the Google authority (the more we have FB likes the better) <br>
. Local business : we can geolocalise <br>
. Product : we can add many info <br>

***
<br>

_Note 1 : When we use structured data for the search engine, Google display only one of our page in the result (but with the structured data)._

_Note 2 :  On mobile results, more things are displayed_

_Note 3 :  Each page has its own structured data_

_Note 4 :  As of Feb 4, 2020 Shopify still uses the old language .RFA (now we can use .json)_

_Note 5 :  In Wordpress there is a rich snippet plugin_

_Note 6 :  We'd better push once the dev is finished because it will play on the Google authority. If Google judge our website low quality, it will read it less often._

_Note 7 :  Errors in our website decrease the G authority_

_Note 8 : Google business will not be free anymore in 2020-2021 (Google announcement)_

Note :  AT THE END ONLY GOOGLE DECIDE WHAT THEY WILL DISPLAY
